# Yuri's Revenge - Community Edition

![YR_CE_Logo_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72227841/173371253-bbb8a9db-5a1d-487f-a88b-e8e6e112f9b7.png)

A mod born out of love for one of the best RTS's of our time. Composed primarily of community based feedback from the  <a href="https://discord.gg/PsJ4WSxGV5">Scorched Earth Discord server</a>. As well as communal assets and contributions, from PPM CnCModHeaven and friends directly. The end goal is to create something I / we feel could have been a legitimate upgrade to Yuri's Revenge without altering the gameplay beyond recognition whilst fixing the awful bugs and imbalances and adding the many new extensions, features to give it fresh look. And hopefully this mod achieves that.
